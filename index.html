    <h1>Robert Tappan Morris</h1>

    <main>

      <p>In 1988, the malware known as Morris worm was launched from a computer at Cornell University, by graduate student Robert Tappan Morris. The worm spread to all internet-connected computers and was designed to be undetectable. A design flaw led it to create more copies than Morris could control, which ultimately led to its detection.</p>

      <p id = "definition">The term worm came from a team of computer engineers from Xerox PARC in the 70s. Similar to Morris, they left a worm unattended overnight to run tests in their computers. When they arrived the next morning, all computers had crashed upon booting up. They coined the term worm from the novel Shockwave Rider, “There’s never been a worm with that tough a head or that long a tail! It’s building itself, don’t you understand?… it can’t be killed. Not short of demolishing the net!”</p>

        <li> A worm is a productivity tool built to move from computer to computer. </li>
        <li> The Morris worm was not a destructive malware </li>
